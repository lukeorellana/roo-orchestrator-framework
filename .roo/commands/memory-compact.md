Summarize the older entries in Memory/ledger.md and Memory/handoffs.md into
Memory/archives/<YYYY-MM>/ledger-<YYYY-MM>.md and handoffs-<YYYY-MM>.md.

Keep only the last ~200 lines in each rolling file.
Write a "Highlights / Decisions / Open Questions" header at the top of each archive file,
and add links/refs to any ADRs or commits. Update Memory/Implementation_Plan.md to reflect any milestone closures.
