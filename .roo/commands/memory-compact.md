Summarize the older entries in .roo-orchestrator/Memory/ledger.md and .roo-orchestrator/Memory/handoffs.md into
.roo-orchestrator/Memory/archives/<YYYY-MM>/ledger-<YYYY-MM>.md and .roo-orchestrator/Memory/archives/<YYYY-MM>/handoffs-<YYYY-MM>.md.

Keep only the last ~200 lines in each rolling file.
Write a "Highlights / Decisions / Open Questions" header at the top of each archive file,
and add links/refs to any ADRs or commits. Update .roo-orchestrator/Memory/Implementation_Plan.md to reflect any milestone closures.
